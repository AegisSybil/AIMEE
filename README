AIMEE
Advanced Infrastructure Monitoring for Enterprise Environments


AIMEE is a monitoring product designed to be easy to configure, deploy and maintain.
The goal of the project is to produce a monitoring and reporting product that is designed to run non-stop.
That means we strive for 100% uptime and 0% downtime.  
For instance if a schedule changes we don't have to reload the whole system, you just push the change and go.
There are numerous other innovations as well in AIMEE.

AIMEE leverages Boost and OpenMPI to create a series of modules that cooperate together.
Those modules are Scheduler/Auditor, Executor, Collator.

The Auditor module is the "brains" of the operation, creating the initial schedules and enforcing them.
The Executor module deals is handed schedules by the Auditor and executes the tasks they contain then passes the results to the Collator.
The Collator module manages the results, notifies the Auditor of their completion and processes the performance data etc.

The original name for AIMEE was ACE (Audit, Collate, Execute). 

AIMEE is the solution to problems we have seen in the overall design of current mainstream monitoring products.
